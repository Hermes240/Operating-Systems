1. On Intel x86 based PCs,druing booting, what does BIOS do?

    BIOS initializes itself, then it checks memory and other devices.
    Some information needed by BIOS are kept in a small cmos RAM, powered 
    by a battery.Then, BIOS looks for a system to boot. The usual booting sequence is 
    A drive (floppy disk), C drive (Hard disk), CDROM, etc.
    which can be changed by programming the BIOS (cmos RAM). 
    First, BIOS tries to boot from drive A: If there is no diskette is A:,
    it will try to boot from C

    How many sectors does BIOS load from the boot device? One sector (SO)

    Where in memory does BIOS load the booter? BIOS loads the MBR to (0x0000, 0x7C00)


2. BIOS loads only 512 bytes of a booter into memory, which is only the 
   beginning part of the booter. How does the booter load the remaining part of 
   the booter into memory?

   During booting, BIOS loads the MBR to (0x0000, 0x7C00) and execute the loaded code in MBR.
   The code in MBR is usually a stage1 booter, which loads and excutes a stage2 booter

4. How do you find the file /boot/mtx?
	First, read in the 0th group descriptor to find the start block of the inodes
	table. Then read in the root inode, which is number 2 inode in the inode table.
	From the root inodeâ€™s data blocks, search for the first component of the file name,
	boot

5. How to load the (disk) blocks of /boot/mtx to the segment 0x1000?
	Set ES to loading segment using. Then load direct blocks and indirect blocks if any
